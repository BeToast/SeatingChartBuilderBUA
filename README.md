# Seating Chart Builder for BellyUp Aspen 

Before each show, a seating chart is created to guide our ushers in seating reserved guests.  
This web application streamlines and enhances the process of building the seating chart for each event.

  

### Potential Functionality  
- upload buyers report so you select from a list of unassigned RES buyers. Rather than just typing any name in.  
- store seating charts in Google Realtime Database/Firestore.
